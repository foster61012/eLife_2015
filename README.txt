Python code by Sebastian FuÌˆrthauer and MATLAB code by Peter Foster

Use intensity_plot.m to extract density profiles from images of contracting
networks averaged over the lengths of the microfluidic channels. Then,
Profile_fitting_example.ipynb is used to fit simulations from the Active Fluid
model to the experimental data.

The python Code depends on numpy, scipy and ipython, which are open source
projects.
